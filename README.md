#### Current Status of Our Project
- Our project is not yet finished but we are close to finishing it, we hope it will be finished till the end of the week.

#### What has been done?
- We have almost finished all the views, we have learnt database and we are getting our models from database storage, also uploading videos to database (We have changed the screen sharing feature a bit, that's why we are uploading videos to the database). We were also able to use database to create new accounts and log in or log out functions.

#### What is left?
- Some of our features are broken (search, capture paint screen etc.), we hope we will be able to fix them.
- Getting info about models from database (adding models to the database with their information as a property).
- A feature to delete the model from the screen.
- Using an ID to see videos from the host.


#### Contributions
- Berk Saltuk Yılmaz: Mostly worked on layouts, views and some features of AR screen such as painting and retrieving video (helped to fix this). Added visuals and features to screens, fixed paint feature. Created Help, AboutUs pages. Added some spacing, fixed some indentation and created a logo for our app! Created an transparent activity for painting feature and made it work. Also tried to help my friends about their parts since we are new to Android projects.

- Enis Özer:I have worked on creating a session mode class by using the existing free mode class, helped on layouts and removing an AR object from the environment. I have also tried to help my friends on fixing and adding some features on paint class. 

- Lara Özyeğen: Mostly worked on the ARScreen and its features like screenshot. In terms of database: I linked firebase with android studio, added methods for account and uploading video to storage. To render our code more understandable I worked on MVC and applied inheritance to the ARScreens. Also I made several views and layouts in the app.

- Onur Asım İlhan: Worked on how to create an AR screen and how to solve the errors that we got. Tried to attend the meetings and tried to help my friends with the errors that they got. However, due to some technical and daily life issues, I could not contribute to the project as much as my friends did.

- Öykü Erhan: Mostly worked on AR Screen features. Worked on capturing screenshots, recording video of paint and ar screen and downloading it to phone. Also worked on uploading videos and getting them from firebase database. Created toolbar and add that to pages. Also worked on creating some layouts.

- Sarper Turan: Mostly worked on AR screen. MVC structure of AR screen. Worked on mostly storage part of database; getting models from database, getting model info from database. Worked on paint and screenshot features with my friends. Also worked on views/layouts and listeners and stuff.

- Yaren Durgun: Mostly worked on database, authentication features such as creating a new account, logging in, logging off etc. For the storage part, attended to uploading and downloading video features. Worked on identifying and clearing the differences between two AR screen types by using hierarchy. Created and edited layouts&comments.
