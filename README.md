#### Current Status of Our Project
- Our project is not yet finished but we are close to finishing it, we are hoping that it would finish till the end of the week

#### What has been done
- We almost finished all the views, we did learn database and we are getting our models from database storage also uploading videos to database (We changed the feature screen sharing a bit that's why we are uploading videos to the database). We were also be able to use database for login.

#### What left
- Some of our features are broken ( search, record etc.) , we are hoping we will fix them.
- Getting info about models from database
- A feature to delete the model from the screen
- Some little bugs ( app crashes when pressed about us etc. )
