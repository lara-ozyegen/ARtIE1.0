On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

Linked my Android Studio to GitHub. Learned the essentials of Android Studio. Main menu has completed. Modes are added. Worked on layouts and sometimes it was  confusing. Learned how to use activities and how to add listeners in Android Studio. Added buttons, image buttons and new pages linked each other. Everything goes right, hopefully!

This week I helped my friends on adding AR fragments to our project. Trying to learn how to deal with Augmented Reality features and trying to add models to our application. Also added new screens as help screen, about us screen, profile screen. Added Firebase Database to our application and we are trying to create profiles and sessions by using this database. We are also trying to add paint and screenshot features to our AR screen. Our menus are almost completed.

This week I attended all project meetings, thanks to decreased workload. Worked on painting feature and fixed it, I helped my friends and we made a significant progress. Our project is almost complete. I failed at some points, I could not fix the search button. We worked as a team and we dealt with all difficulties.

This week we managed to fix retrieving video class. Now we can upload videos to our database and then we can retrieve the video by typing the name of the video. I attended all project meetings which held this week. Our project is about to be done. We are now concentrating on our demo video. It makes me proud to see we made such a great progress as a team. It was difficult but also fun. We love CS!
