On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 20/04/2020 - 27/04/2020 ~
This week I started building easy apps by using android studio. This way I realized it wasn't hard to manage. Then with my friends we tried building a simple AR screen. We get a problem about the version and couldn't fix it however I learned how to use github and how to add permissions from this experience. Then I myself tried building the app two more times and failed. This time I get a different error and couldn't run the app. This happened when I update the android studio so I assume the new version does not support some methods of ARcore.
