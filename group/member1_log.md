On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week I started building easy apps by using android studio. This way I realized it wasn't hard to manage. Then with my friends we tried building a simple AR screen. We get a problem about the version and couldn't fix it however I learned how to use github and how to add permissions from this experience. Then I myself tried building the app two more times and failed. This time I get a different error and couldn't run the app. This happened when I update the android studio so I assume the new version does not support some methods of ARcore.

This week I linked firebase to android studio and added screenshot feature. I couldn't fix a bug in screenshot, it shows black screen. I tried several different methods like drawing on canvas etc. but none of them worked. I learned more about layouts and converted some layouts to constraint. We switched tasks with Sarper and I tried to solve the bug in drawing feature. I came up with a solution of using fragment instead of activity but one method caused a problem. I searched a lot about how to make screen recording it is very complex so I suggested that we upload videos to database and get from there when necessary. We learned how to create account and I added delete acount feature.

This week I tried inheritance for the second ARscreen to avoid repetition. There are some extras in second AR screen but it is not possible to inherit layout in android studio so I created an invisible button in ARscreen and set invisible and disabled. Then, set it visible and enabled in the second ARscreen. It didn't work at first but it turned out that I should have written the methods to the wrong ARscreen class. Also I wrote controller classes for view model to apply MVC more to our project. I wrote the code for changing the filename in database and created the UI layout for that.
