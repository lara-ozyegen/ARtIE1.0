On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week I have learned about using gitHub and some essential functionalities of Android Studio such as creating a button and adding a listener to it which is somewhat similar to what we have done in classes. I have learned about xml files and helped my friend on channging an attribute of an item via only interfering with the text on the xml file.

This week I have tried to use an emulater to run the application but my computers C folder does not have enough space, I have reinstalled the Android Studio but the emulator still can't figure out to install itself on D folder so I am running the application on my mobile android device (my phone in less cooler way) using AWD Manager and enabling developer options. Other that that I have helped my friend on creating the session mode class without repeating as minimum code as possible. 

### ~ 04/05/2020 - 11/05/2020 ~
This week I have worked on removing an AR object from the screen. I have found some methods and their source codes in stackoverflow but all the methods are giving me lots of errors, I am currently trying to solve them.

### ~ 11/05/2020 - 18/05/2020 ~
This week I have helped my friends on adding the addModel function to the app. Even though we have worked for long time on this addModel function, it seems like we are not gonna make it.
