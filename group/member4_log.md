On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

Linked my Android Studio to GitHub. Learned the essentials of Android Studio. Main menu has completed. Modes are added. Worked on layouts and sometimes it was  confusing. Learned how to use activities and how to add listeners in Android Studio. Added buttons, image buttons and new pages linked each other. Everything goes right, hopefully!

This week I helped my friends on adding AR fragments to our project. Trying to learn how to deal with Augmented Reality features and trying to add models to our application. Also added new screens as help screen, about us screen, profile screen. Added Firebase Database to our application and we are trying to create profiles and sessions by using this database. We are also trying to add paint and screenshot features to our AR screen. Our menus are almost completed.
