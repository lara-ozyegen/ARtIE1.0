On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 20/04/2020 - 27/04/2020 ~
Learned GitHub – Finished the opening screen of the app, learned how activities are linked.
Created login screen as a pop-up with team members and created activities for pages.
Learned more about intents and intent filters, tried adding ClickListener to images but we changed it afterwards to buttons. Little changes about android toolbars.
Learned how to open AR screen and inserting an model. It worked pretty well. Preview pop-up screen had some issues with layout, we fixed it. Also I think I learned more about constraint layouts more this week.

This week first we focused on some of the features in our AR screen. I worked on our paint feature but couldn't achieve what we were expecting to do because in the paint I created, it creates an activity and the current AR screen we used -with the models in it- disappears, we have to find a way to make that activity transparent maybe ? I also helped Lara and Öykü at toolbar and screenshot button. I added home and search button to the toolbar but search button is not working properly. Then Yaren and I tried to learn database and implement it on our project where we need the users - authentication etc. - It is actually working well. The problem is this week we understood that our app was not following the MVC pattern, we are trying to fix our app, I am working on a ARScreenModels models where I try to get the models from the database, then insert it to the screen in controller. It seems like it is going good for now but I am not so sure since I am newly starting to understand the MVC pattern.

This week I worked more on the MVC pattern for AR screen and models, even though the difference between Views and Controllers are not visible, I was able to create a model, now we can get the models from database by their name, which saved us from a lot of unnecessary classes and code. I am planning to do the same for info of the models too so we can handle it in one class by just geting the name and calling it from database. Then I helped my friends with little features. Learning database was hard and even though I know I learned like just the %5 percent of it, it is fun and now I feel more confident. This week I spent lesser time than last weeks but I had to finish my Research Paper but I am pretty sure I can recover this by working harder next week.

This week I was able to finish getting model info from database using realtime database. Now we can get the info of the model and the model itself from database with just the name of the wanted model. There is no issue with code-related things but we are struggling a bit with free mode/ session mode difference. I also fixed some little mistakes/crashes in our app. Now we are trying to play the video we retrieved from the storage with Yaren,Lara and Öykü by creating an activity with VideoView, then we will take the VideoView we got from database and place it to the VideoView. After that we will probably fix the little crashes in our app and finish.
We were able to finish taking video from database and play it, I worked on problems occured during that with my friends, then I added play/pause buttons and timer of the video to the screen, added some models and model info to our database and lastly added some comments. Now we will talk about our presentation and share tasks, then we are done :)

### ~ 18/05/2020 - 25/05/2020 ~
I didn't change our code much except some indentation/layout mistakes and stuff. Edited our youtube video with Yaren and wrote reflections/readme2.txt with my team mates.
