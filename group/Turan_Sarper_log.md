On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

Learned GitHub – Finished the opening screen of the app, learned how activities are linked.
Created login screen as a pop-up with team members and created activities for pages.
Learned more about intents and intent filters, tried adding ClickListener to images but we changed it afterwards to buttons. Little changes about android toolbars.
Learned how to open AR screen and inserting an model. It worked pretty well. Preview pop-up screen had some issues with layout, we fixed it. Also I think I learned more about constraint layouts more this week.

This week first we focused on some of the features in our AR screen. I worked on our paint feature but couldn't achieve what we were expecting to do. I also helped Lara and Öykü at toolbar and screenshot button. They are also not working how they are supposed to. Then Yaren and I tried to learn database and implement it on our project where we need the users - authentication etc. - It is actually working well. The problem is this week we understood that our app was not following the MVC pattern, we are trying to fix our app, I am working on a ARScreenModels models where I try to get the models from the database, then insert it to the screen in controller. It seems like it is going good for now but I am not so sure since I am newly starting to understand the MVC pattern.
