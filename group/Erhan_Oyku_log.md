On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

This week tried to learn how android studio and github works. Learned how to create activities, activity buttons and layouts to new pages. After, tried to understand AR core and adding models to ar screen. Also at first, I added mathematics category page and layout besides biology but we decide to focus more on biology so I removed it. After I try to do what happens when press to add model button. It opens phone's download page for now but it doesn't pick any file. Learned about pop ups and importance of constraint layouts.

This week I focused on mostly AR screen features. Watch so many videos about captureing and recording screen includes the camera view and 3d model. After a while I manage to do recording a video and saving it to phone part. I also look to screenshot problem with Lara and Sarper which when click, it saves black screen with buttons. But this week we couldn't manage to fix. I added toolbars to pages with some buttons on it and after Sarper developed that with more buttons like search but search button isn't working right for now. I also research and watch so many videos about screen mirroring android to android but I couldn't mannage to apply it to our project. Learned the importance of "user permission".

This week I mosty look how to download videos to database and getting it by password with Yaren and Lara. We first remove the preview video when recording is finished and add a pop up screen which asks if the user wants to add that video to database. We manage to upload and ask user file name to database but we are still working on getting that video by some one time code part. I return the screenshot problem again and this time I understand that we have to use ar screen view when getting the view instead of getting root. So when changing that and the method itself screenshot works quite right I think. Also try to add record video button to our paint view screen and it also is working. But screenshot in paint screen is not getting the paint view for now. It is just getting the background and stuff. But I will look at it again and try to add paint view when creating a bitmap.
